Along the way you'll learn how to  manipulate, visualize, and ultimately model data sets in DSX.\n\n\n#### Table of Contents\n\n1. Problem Statement\n\n2. Load Data from IBM Object Storage\n\n3.

Conclusion\n\n______________________\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nThe service bays at dealerships have seen an increase in warranty claims related to brakes. However, it may not always make sense to honor a warranty claim.  Sometimes the brake issue may be due to vehicle malfunction; other times it can be due to aggressive driving style.  \n\n>Using historical telematics data of known driver types, can we classify the driving style of customers making warranty claims?  If so, we'll be able to provide a service to dealerships that allows them to classify the brake event and driver type for customers making a warranty claim.  \n\nTo do this you will need to analyze connected car data to discover the various patterns associated with different drivers.  *Please keep in mind that the hints often contain the solution to the exercise, so consider that before using them.*\n\n__Note:__  Before we dive in, double click on this text.

The data types are all coded as 'string'.  Before we can compute any statistics or aggregations we'll need to cast these into the proper types.  Welcome to data analysis, where the data is dirty and the work is cut out for you! \n\n#### SparkSQL\n\nThere are different ways to do this in Spark but perhaps the simplest and most intuitive way is to use SparkSQL.  While not entirely ANSI compliant, SparkSQL is a powerful way for SQL developers to work on big data.  Let's start with the basics and then work toward changing the types.\n\n##### Querying a Temporary View\n\nIn order to run queries in familiar SQL syntax you'll need to create a temporary view.  To do this, call the `.createOrReplaceTempView()` method on your existing DataFrame.  Note that the table name is one of the parameters and must be in quotes.\n<br><br>\n<div class=\"panel-group\" id=\"accordion-1\">\n  <div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n    <div class=\"panel-heading\">\n      <h4 class=\"panel-title\">\n        <a data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion-32\" href=\"#collapse1-32\">\n        Hint</a>\n      </h4>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"collapse1-32\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\">\n      <div class=\"panel-body\">Try: df_data_1.createOrReplaceTempView(\"yourtablename\"), but replace 'yourtablename' with what you want to call your table. </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>"}, {"outputs": [], "cell_type": "code", "source": "## Create the temporary view here\n\nbrakeEventsDF.createOrReplaceTempView(\"BE_Table\")", "execution_count": 7, "metadata": {"collapsed": true}}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Good.  Now we can access the SparkSession (remember?) and run queries against the temporary table.\n\nThe syntax for this is,\n\n> SparkSession.sql(\"*insert SQL statement here*\")\n\nKeep in mind you are running queries against the **temp table** and not the DataFrame.  Try a simple _\"SELECT * FROM yourtablename\"_ statement and see what is returned.  You may have to add a command that you've already learned to display the data. \n\n<br>\n <div class=\"panel-group\" id=\"accordion-31\">\n  <div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n    <div

When the variable you want to understand or predict is continuous or numeric (such as price, braking score, etc.) it is generally considered a regression problem.  However if you want to classify a data point as belonging to a particular group (such as aggressive, quality, or distracted) then it makes more sense to use a classification model.  In this exercise we will use a variant of the decision tree model - Random Forest - for classification.\n\n#### SparkML\n\nApache Spark has a rich set of algorithms and data transformations included in the API that can be used for machine learning.  That's the great part!  The tricky part is that the models are built to accept the data in a particular format so some additional data preparation is required.  \n\n##### Feature Selection\n\nThe first thing we are going to do is select the columns - features - we want to include in our model.  These features will be modeled against the variable we want to understand, also referred to as the label.  In other words we are going to provide the model with a list of features and their corresponding label (quality, aggressive, etc.).  It will learn the relationship between each feature and the different labels, allowing us to make predictions as to what the label should be given new values for the features.\n\nIn the code cell below, specify the names of the columns you want to include as your **features**.  Store the result in a new variable, `inputColumns`.\n\n**Note:  For the sake of simplicity, leave out any columns of datatype 'string' from your features.**\n\n<br>\n <div class=\"panel-group\" id=\"accordion-67\">\n  <div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n    <div class=\"panel-heading\">\n      <h4 class=\"panel-title\">\n        <a data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion-1\" href=\"#collapse1-67\">\n        Hint</b></a>\n      </h4>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"collapse1-67\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\">\n      <div class=\"panel-body\">Try: <br>\n      `inputColumns = [\"brake_distance_ft\", \"brake_time_sec\", \"abs_event\"]` <br>\n      Make sure to include any columns you think affect the event type.</div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>"}, {"outputs": [], "cell_type": "code", "source": "## Specify columns to include here.

The concept here is that the model has generalized the relationship between your labels and the features, but only based on the data points you provided. Feeding the model new rows of data it has never seen before and then checking to see if its predictions were correct will give you a sense of how well it has captured the relationship between the features and their labels.\n\n<br>\n  <div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n    <div class=\"panel-heading\">\n      <h4 class=\"panel-title\">\n        <a data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion-99\" href=\"#collapse2-99\">\n        Advanced Optional</a>\n      </h4>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"collapse2-99\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\">\n      <div class=\"panel-body\">See if you can show the predicted types alongside the actual types and the features column.

In this case the business may want to provide an application that service bays can use to check the recent driving behavior of customers.  Imagine providing customized service at the dealership based on the driving tendencies of the customer.  The possibilities for improving customer experience and increasing profit are real, but first you need to make this predictive model available to others in your organization. \n\nAs your final task, save your pipeline to the UNIX system then push it to Object Storage.\n\n##### Save and Zip Pipeline\n\nWhen you save your pipeline it will create a directory in the local file system on DSX.  Before we can put it in Object Storage we'll have to zip the contents into a single file.\n\nSaving a model or pipeline in Spark is pretty easy.

You've built a Random Forest classifier that can accurately predict the type of brake event based on features surrounding braking distance, time, and others.  This model can help better understand the tendencies of various drivers and optimize operations in different parts of the automotive business.  A real world data set will likely not be as straightforward as the one you worked with here (it almost certainly won't).  However, the methodology and basic techniques have been laid out to help you on your way towards building data products infused with machine learning.  \n\nBefore you go, please take a moment to review the material that you have completed in this lab!
